I can give you some general guidance on how to recover your Bitcoin.

If you're having trouble accessing your Bitcoin, you may want to try contacting the support team of the exchange or wallet where you stored your Bitcoin. They may be able to assist you in recovering your access.

Additionally, you can also try contacting a reputable cryptocurrency recovery service, such as SACLUX COMPTECH SPECIALST . They specialize in helping individuals recover lost or stolen cryptocurrencies.

Please keep in mind that recovering lost or stolen cryptocurrencies can be a complex and challenging process. There are no guarantees of success except you meet with the right expert, and that is why I will always recommend SACLUX COMPTECH SPECIALST to scam victims because they are the only company that is legit when it comes to cryptocurrency recovery. It's also important to be cautious of scams and phishing attempts and to only work with reputable and trustworthy services.
